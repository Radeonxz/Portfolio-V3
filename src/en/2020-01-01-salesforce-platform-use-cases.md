# Discover Use Cases for the Platform

## High Impact, Low Effort

Every time you create a custom object, you automatically get something called `Chatter feed tracking`. `Chatter feed tracking` provides a way for multiple people to comment and collaborate on a particular record. The discussions and decisions are stored on the `record` so everyone can stay up to date on important decisions.

Processes with these traits are great candidates for early projects on the Salesforce platform:

- Heavy email collaboration
- Reliance on spreadsheets
- Shared local documents
- Time-intensive, repetitive manual steps
- Impact on only a few departments (you want to minimize the number of stakeholders while youâ€™re still learning)

## HR Can Use the Platform

Here are some things the custom app can do:

- List job openings.
- Store applicants for each job opening.
- Send automated reminders to hiring managers.
- Store orientation and training plans.
- Manage equipment orders.
- Track employee time off.

## IT Can Use the Platform

Here are some other ways to streamline IT using the Salesforce platform:

- Create reports and dashboard to aggregate and analyze requests.
- Send confirmation emails when requests are received, completed, or updated.
- Queue incoming requests.
- Create custom forms for employee requests and create a knowledge base for common issues.
- Track employee hardware assets.
